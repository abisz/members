# Vienna.html Members Directory

Welcome. Join Us. Free. No Database Required - Just Some YAML ;-) 


## How To Add Yourself

Step 1: Add yourself to the member list, that is, [members.yml](members.yml). Example:

``` yaml
- name:    Henry Jekyll                 # your name (required)
  github:  henryj                       # your github handle (required)
  web:     drjkeylls.com                # blog or website address/url (optional)
  twitter: henry                        # your github handle (optional)
```

Step 2: There's no Step 2 ;-)

That's it. Thanks! Wait for the next site update to get listed on the members page. Welcome to Vienna.html.
